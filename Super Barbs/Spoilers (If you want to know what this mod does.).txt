What this mod adds:
-Some leader traits to barbarians, financial, expansive, protective, aggressive, charismatic.
-Unique units, such as Quechuas and Praetorians.
-Lets Barbs make more units, like chariots, musketmen, cavalry, tanks, submarines, stealth destroyers, ICBMs. (Haven't tested the ICBMs but they do in fact get chariots/immortals.)
-Barbs get duns, totem poles, Gers.
-Barbs should be able to make settlers.
-Great wall is unlocked at construction and has cost doubled.
